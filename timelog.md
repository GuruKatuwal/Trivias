High level overview of what I did:
I wrote some of the tests for our classes and the Trivia entity. I did some of the pull request
reviews and merging them in. Did some reverts in our code and some debugging. I
set up our AWS instance and deployed our project there. A majority of my time was 
spent debugging and deploying multiple times to make sure things worked.

11/4-11/14:
* About 1.5 hours - setting up the repository and getting the structure in place
* about 30 minutes - writing the Trivia entity
* In class planning time total probably 2-3 hours  

11/16: 
* 2 hours getting all the last pull requests review and merged in, 
getting the AWS instance set up, checking test coverage, and debugging

11/17:
* 4.5 hours finalizing the AWS stuff, getting the project deployed to AWS, testing the form, testing the URL,
making sure all types of requests worked, debugging things that weren't working, redeploying

11/18:
* 1 hour, final deploy to AWS, double check that everything's working- finishing touches.
